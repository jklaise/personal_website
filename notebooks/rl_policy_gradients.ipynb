    "# Policy gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "Policy gradients is a family of algorithms for solving reinforcement learning problems by directly optimizing the policy in policy space. This is in stark contrast to value based approaches (such as Q-learning used in [Learning Atari games by DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/research/publications/playing-atari-deep-reinforcement-learning). Policy gradients have several appealing properties, for one they produce stochastic policies (by learning a probability distribution over actions given observations) whereas value based approaches are deterministic as they will typically choose actions greedily with respect to the value function being learned which can lead to under-exploration (one needs to introduce exploration strategies such as $\\epsilon$-greedy explicitly to get around this). Another advantage of policy gradients is their ability to tackle continuous action spaces without discretisation which is necessary for value based methods. This is not to say that value based approaches are useless, one of the biggest disadvantages of policy gradients is their high variance estimates of the gradient updates. This leads to very noisy gradient estimates and can de-stabilize the learning process. I think it is fair to say that a lot of reinforcement learning research with policy gradients in the past few years has been about trying to reduce the variance of these gradient updates to improve the trainability of these algorithms. It is also worth mentioning that in state-of-the-art implementations and tasks it is common to use the so called actor-critic algorithms which includes a policy gradient and a value function estimator to combine the best properties of both approaches.\n",

The observation at each states is a vector of length 4 (describing physical properties of the pole, [position of cart, velocity of cart, angle of pole, rotation rate of pole](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/classic_control/cartpole.py#L21)) [^2] and the possible set of actions at each step is binary - move the cart left or right.

    "We can see from this plot that our agent does learn to control the cart! It looks like it is starting to be able to balance the pole for 200 steps after ~500 episodes. Note, however, that the reward plot exhibits the typical high-variance of policy gradient methods, even after 1000+ episodes the learned policy can be unstable and lead to sub-par performance. This could be mitigated by employing some simple variance reduction techniques (the first thing to try would be increase the number of episodes per gradient update) and also employing learning rate scheduling so that when we learn a good policy we don't deviate too much from it[^4]. Also, it would be helpful and is indeed necessary to run the training multiple times with different random seeds to get an estimate of mean performance over time (with standard errors), this would be essential to compare the performance of different algorithms against each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^4]: In practice the [Proximal Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347) is used which prohibits policy updates that are too large.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a joke that reinforcement learning is the only area of machine learning where it's acceptable to test on the training set which is kind of what we've done by looking at the performance during training (in practice this is not a problem as the environment does not change between training and evaluation unless you are specifically studying robustness of RL methods which require good performance at test time on environments unseen at training time). Additionally, we can load the last saved policy from disk and look at it's performance on the environment:"

    "When I was first implementing policy gradients, I used the basic form of the policy gradient with $R(\\tau)$ multiplying every grad-log-prob term in an episode and could not get the policy to converge. Even though both the $R(\\tau)$ and temporally-adjusted formulations of the policy gradient have the same expected value, the variance is different. Unsurprisingly, using the first version gives high-variance gradient updates which in some cases may be severe enough to prevent converging to the optimal policy within the allotted time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Re-writing the policy gradient expression to take into account only rewards obtained after taking an action is a *variance reduction* technique and a lot of the progress on policy gradient methods has been centered around finding equivalent (in expected value) gradient update rules with reduced variance thus making the training more stable and likely to converge to the optimal policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "I like to group variance reduction techniques in two groups, simple and less-simple. The simple ones include:\n",
    " - Temporal reward structure (as discussed here)\n",
    " - Increasing number of episodes per gradient update\n",
    " - Introducing the discount factor $\\gamma$\n",
    " - Reward normalization (subtract mean, divide by standard deviation)\n",
    " \n",
    "The more complex ones are:\n",
    " - Introducing a baseline (multiple choices, but often leads to the action-value or advantage function and actor-critic methods)\n",
    " - Generalized advantage estimation (GAE) - this introduces a set of hyper-parameters to introduce some bias in the policy gradient update to control variance even further ([see the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02438)). I recommend [this blog post](https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2017/04/02/notes-on-the-generalized-advantage-estimation-paper/) for a write-up.\n",

    "In logistic regression we use the parametrized logistic function $f_\\theta(x)=\\dfrac{e^{\\theta\\cdot x}}{1+e^{\\theta\\cdot x}}$ where $\\theta, x$ are the $k$-dimensional weight and feature vectors respectively (we assume the bias term is incorporated within $\\theta$ and $x$). Because there are only two classes, we interpret the value of $f_\\theta(x)$ as $p(y=1\\vert \\theta,x)$, i.e. the probability of the first class. Then we get the probability of the second class for free since probabilities must sum to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parametrized softmax function defined as $\\sigma_\\theta(x)_i=\\dfrac{e^{\\theta_i\\cdot x}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{m}e^{\\theta_j\\cdot x}}$ for $i=1,\\dots,m$ is a generalization of the logistic function to $m$ output classes and extends logistic regression to multi-class problems. We interpret the value of $\\sigma_\\theta(x)_i$ as $p(y=i\\vert \\theta_i, x)$ for $i=1,\\dots,m$. Note that with softmax there is a separate weight vector $\\theta_i$ for each of the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a subtle difference in going from the logistic function to the softmax function that is rarely explained but becomes apparent when you compare using the softmax function instead of the logistic function for a two-class problem. Essentially, the logistic function only maintains a parameter vector $\\theta$ of length $k$ for estimating the first class probability while the softmax function maintains a separate parameter vector for each of the classes, thus in the two-class case a softmax formulation would have $2k$ parameters - twice as many as in logistic regression. This means that the softmax formulation results in redundant parameters - this is called overparametrization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write this out in detail. The class probabilities for an m-class problem are given by\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we can pick $\\phi=\\theta_0$ thus setting the first parameter vector to be identically zero in effect eliminating $k$ redundant parameters from calculations. Doing so in the $2$-class problem we would recover ordinary logistic regression with $k$ parameters, i.e. setting $\\theta_0\\to 0$ and $\\theta_1\\to\\theta_1-\\theta_0=:\\theta$ would give $p_0=\\dfrac{1}{1+e^{\\theta\\cdot x}}$ and $p_1=\\dfrac{e^{\\theta\\cdot x}}{1+e^{\\theta\\cdot x}}$ as in vanilla logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our cartpole example because we used a vanilla logistic policy we ended up with four trainable weights, one for each of the observations. However, had we gone for a softmax policy with two classes we would have eight trainable weights instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an $m$-class problem, the number of weights maintained by softmax is $m\\times k$ but $k$ of these can be eliminated as shown. In practice, however, it is less hassle to keep the softmax formulation as is since enforcing some parameters to be zero would lead to less clean code and extra difficulties when calculating gradients.\n",
