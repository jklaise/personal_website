## Hi, I'm Janis!

I am a London based Data Scientist. I'm interested in more things than I have
time for to study. I strive to understand algorithms, modelling approaches
and programming principles from the ground up which I sometimes share on this blog.

### Current
 - I work at [Seldon](https://www.seldon.io/) in London. I focus on designing algorithms
 and developing software to enable monitoring of production
machine learning systems.
 - I develop and maintain a machine learning interpretation library [Alibi](https://github.com/SeldonIO/alibi).
 - I've co-authored a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02584) on counterfactual
 explanations to machine learning model predictions.

### Past
 - I did a PhD in Mathematics and Complexity Science at the University of Warwick,
 supervised by [Samuel Johnson](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/maths/johnson-samuel.aspx).
 My [thesis](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/157859545.pdf) is on Network
 Scienceâ€”understanding and modelling complex interconnected systems.
 - I've mentored startups about productionising their machine learning in the [Google Cloud](https://twitter.com/GoogleCloud_UKI) ML kickstarter.
 - I've participated in several Alan Turing Institute [Data Study Groups](https://www.turing.ac.uk/collaborate-turing/data-study-groups) and [European Study Groups with Industry](https://ecmiindmath.org/study-groups/).
 - I've taught Maths & Stats and computing to undergraduate students in Mathematics and Business
 students at the University of Warwick.
