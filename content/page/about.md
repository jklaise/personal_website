### Hi, I'm Janis!

I am a London based Data Scientist. After finishing a [PhD in Mathematics and
Complexity Science] (https://go.warwick.ac.uk/jklaise) and a [data science
internship](http://spectraanalytics.com) I decided that developing data-driven
solutions to inform and drive business would be the perfect career path for me.

This is a personal website where I plan to blog about my personal data science
projects, machine learning algorithms, mathematical hurdles I come across when
solving problems, tips and best-practice in using **Python** and **R** and their
scientific libraries (the top two programming languages for any aspiring data
scientist!) and whatever else I find useful and interesting.

There is a lot of great data science content out there, most of it in the form
of blogs, and a big part of my knowledge is due the people providing this
content completely free of charge. I hope to give back to the community in the
form of providing my own (hopefully at least somewhat useful!) thoughts.
